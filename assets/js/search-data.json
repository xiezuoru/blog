            "content": "给梁森山新书写的序：创客教育何以持续十年 . . 2017年，我应邀参加第三届中国教育创新成果公益博览会活动。我校报送的教学成果《“课程、空间、活动”三位一体的创客教育实践》获得了SERVE大奖。按照组委会要求，我需要在领奖仪式上做一分钟的演讲。如果从2008年建立科技制作社开始算起，我的创客教育已经持续了九年。用一分钟来归纳九年的工作，难度自然很大。转念一想，组委会实际上是要求我，用最简洁的话来回答三个问题： . 1.为什么做创客教育？ . 2.创客教育做得怎么样了？ . 3.接下来准备怎么做创客教育？ . 经过一周时间的反复思考，我写下了如下一段话： . 当我决定温州中学创客空间要向全校开放的时候，并没有意识到自己已经打开了一扇新的教育大门。几年后，总有老师、校长、专家问我，创客教育该怎么做。今天我来到这里，想告诉所有的关注创客教育的教育者，创客教育不是仅仅建一个高大上的创客空间，也不是仅仅带学生去获几个国家大奖，申报几个发明专利，而是应该从课程、空间和活动，多个维度去实施。没有课程，我们的学生不知道如何“造物”；没有空间，我们的学生没有地方“造物”；没有活动，如何让更多的孩子爱上“造物”？感谢教博会给我机会，给温州中学机会，给中国创客教育机会。 . 估计很少有人用这样的话来作为教学成果的领奖感言。但我清楚地知道，这段话能够很好地表达我的初心。2015年国内创客教育爆发，我最担心的莫过于全国各地兴起大建创客空间的风气，然后投入多的学校就成为了当地实施创客教育的典范。我还担心有些教育管理部门，用获奖次数和等级作为重要标准来评价学校的创客教育实施情况。这些做法对还处于萌芽阶段的创客教育来说是有害无益的，不仅会伤害了一批踏踏实实做创客教育的学校，还会将创客教育导向形式主义。 . 我在台上演讲的时候，老梁（我们对梁森山老师的称呼）就在现场。他是来参加我校负责的特别节目——一个以“展望创客教育十年”为主题的沙龙活动。严格说，他和吴俊杰、傅骞、丁书林等老师，是专门来为我鼓掌的。这颇让我感动。在那段颇为困难的时期，我们彼此之间都有了那种抱团取暖、相互依赖的特殊感情。 . 创客教育的实施，需要“课程、空间、活动”三位一体。这已经成为我们这批教育创客们的共识。“课程、空间、活动”其实还是评价创客教育的几个重要维度。对有钱的学校来说，建一个创客空间或许很容易，但同时还要开设课程，组织创客活动就不容易做到了，这要真刀真枪地干起来。同样，那些以科创竞赛获奖而出名的学校，我们也可以用这样的评价指标，引导他们除了参加竞赛，还要开设普惠的课程，要建设能够向所有学生开放的创客空间。 . 为了有效引领国内的创客教育，老梁在幕后做了很多努力。在我们的圈子内部，往往用“扫地僧”来称呼他。2015年，他花了很多精力编写了一本《中国创客教育蓝皮书（基础教育版）》，记录创客教育发展史上的一些故事，成为研究中国创客教育的必读书籍。他还通过各种人脉，帮我们这些早期教育创客建立一个组织，就是大家熟悉的中国电子学会现代教育技术分会创客教育专委会（现在更名为中国电子学会现代教育技术分会创客教育专家组），每年一次的STEAM教育大会从此有了国家级的主办方。申报教育部教育装备研究与发展中心的课题，也是在2015年做的一项重要工作。他申报的课题名称为《校园创客活动与创客空间建设案例研究》，我应邀参与，并作为这个课题组的核心成员开展研究工作。 . 经过四年的努力，我们回头看看，这个课题已经完成了当时的既定目标：了解当前校园创客空间建设和校园创客活动的基本情况，在此基础上形成研究报告。围绕“如何建设校园创客空间”和“如何开展校园创客活动”等问题，精选国内案例，帮助基层教育工作者有序地开展创客教育。 . 创客教育能够坚持多久？我们不敢轻易预言，只能用十年来作为一个节点，一步一步地完成目标。最早的十年目标，是我在2015年的一次全国会议上提出，算起来差不多过了一半时间。虽然当时担心的一些情况也有发生，但总体上创客教育的发展情况良好。全国各地相继出台了实施或者推进创客教育的政策，创客空间如雨后春笋般建立，开源硬件写入了高中信息技术课程标准，“创意物化”成为中小学综合实践活动课程的重要目标，国产开源硬件项目“虚谷计划”启动并得到广泛支持。 . 创客教育何以持续十年？因为有老梁在内的很多教育创客的坚持。他们之中有教育管理部门的领导，也有高校的知名专家，有些在幕前摇旗呐喊，有些在幕后默默支持。没有他们的共同努力，就不会有创客教育的今天。 . 如果有人问老梁，这些年的最大感受是什么？我想老梁会回答：虽然很累，但痛并快乐着。如果有人问我，这些年的最大收获是什么？我会回答：大家都还在呢，一群人会走得很远。 . 谢作如 . 2019.10.22 . 购买链接：https://item.jd.com/67911009902.html .",

            "title": "GitHub Actions: Providing Data Scientists With New Superpowers",
            "content": "What Superpowers? . Hi, I’m Hamel Husain. I’m a machine learning engineer at GitHub. Recently, GitHub released a new product called GitHub Actions, which has mostly flown under the radar in the machine learning and data science community as just another continuous integration tool. . Recently, I’ve been able to use GitHub Actions to build some very unique tools for Data Scientists, which I want to share with you today. Most importantly, I hope to get you excited about GitHub Actions, and the promise it has for giving you new superpowers as a Data Scientist. Here are two projects I recently built with Actions that show off its potential: . fastpages . fastpages is an automated, open-source blogging platform with enhanced support for Jupyter notebooks. You save your notebooks, markdown, or Word docs into a directory on GitHub, and they automatically become blog posts. Read the announcement below: . We&#39;re launching `fastpages`, a platform which allows you to host a blog for free, with no ads. You can blog with @ProjectJupyter notebooks, @office Word, directly from @github&#39;s markdown editor, etc.Nothing to install, &amp; setup is automated!https://t.co/dNSA0oQUrN . &mdash; Jeremy #Masks4All Howard (@jeremyphoward) February 24, 2020 Machine Learning Ops . Wouldn’t it be cool if you could invoke a chatbot natively on GitHub to test your machine learning models on the infrastructure of your choice (GPUs), log all the results, and give you a rich report back in a pull request so that everyone could see the results? You can with GitHub Actions! . Consider the below annotated screenshot of this Pull Request: . . A more in-depth explanation about the above project can be viewed in this video: . Using GitHub Actions for machine learning workflows is starting to catch on. Julien Chaumond, CTO of Hugging Face, says: . GitHub Actions are great because they let us do CI on GPUs (as most of our users use the library on GPUs not on CPUs), on our own infra! 1 . Additionally, you can host a GitHub Action for other people so others can use parts of your workflow without having to re-create your steps. I provide examples of this below. . A Gentle Introduction To GitHub Actions . What Are GitHub Actions? . GitHub Actions allow you to run arbitrary code in response to events. Events are activities that happen on GitHub such as: . Opening a pull request | Making an issue comment | Labeling an issue | Creating a new branch | … and many more | . When an event is created, the GitHub Actions context is hydrated with a payload containing metadata for that event. Below is an example of a payload that is received when an issue is created: . { &quot;action&quot;: &quot;created&quot;, &quot;issue&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;: 444500041, &quot;number&quot;: 1, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Spelling error in the README file&quot;, &quot;user&quot;: { &quot;login&quot;: &quot;Codertocat&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;User&quot;, }, &quot;labels&quot;: [ { &quot;id&quot;: 1362934389, &quot;node_id&quot;: &quot;MDU6TGFiZWwxMzYyOTM0Mzg5&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;bug&quot;, } ], &quot;body&quot;: &quot;It looks like you accidently spelled &#39;commit&#39; with two &#39;t&#39;s.&quot; } . This functionality allows you to respond to various events on GitHub in an automated way. In addition to this payload, GitHub Actions also provide a plethora of variables and environment variables that afford easy to access metadata such as the username and the owner of the repo. Additionally, other people can package useful functionality into an Action that other people can inherit. For example, consider the below Action that helps you publish python packages to PyPi: . The Usage section describes how this Action can be used: . - name: Publish a Python distribution to PyPI uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@master with: user: __token__ password: ${{ secrets.pypi_password }} . This Action expects two inputs: user and a password. You will notice that the password is referencing a variable called secrets, which is a variable that contains an encrypted secret that you can upload to your GitHub repository. There are thousands of Actions (that are free) for a wide variety of tasks that can be discovered on the GitHub Marketplace. The ability to inherit ready-made Actions in your workflow allows you to accomplish complex tasks without implementing all of the logic yourself. Some useful Actions for those getting started are: . actions/checkout: Allows you to quickly clone the contents of your repository into your environment, which you often want to do. This does a number of other things such as automatically mount your repository’s files into downstream Docker containers. | mxschmitt/action-tmate: Proivdes a way to debug Actions interactively. This uses port forwarding to give you a terminal in the browser that is connected to your Actions runner. Be careful not to expose sensitive information if you use this. | actions/github-script: Gives you a pre-authenticated ocotokit.js client that allows you to interact with the GitHub API to accomplish almost any task on GitHub automatically. Only these endpoints are supported (for example, the secrets endpoint is not in that list). | . In addition to the aforementioned Actions, it is helpful to go peruse the official GitHub Actions docs before diving in. . Example: A fastpages Action Workflow . The best to way familiarize yourself with Actions is by studying examples. Let’s take a look at the Action workflow that automates the build of fastpages (the platform used to write this blog post). . Part 1: Define Workflow Triggers . blog, defined in ci.yaml. Like all Actions workflows, this is YAML file is located in the .github/workflows directory of the GitHub repo. . The top of this YAML file looks like this: . name: CI on: push: branches: - master pull_request: . This means that this workflow is triggered on either a push or pull request event. Furthermore, push events are filtered such that only pushes to the master branch will trigger the workflow, whereas all pull requests will trigger this workflow. It is important to note that pull requests opened from forks will have read-only access to the base repository and cannot access any secrets for security reasons. The reason for defining the workflow in this way is we wanted to trigger the same workflow to test pull requests as well as build and deploy the website when a PR is merged into master. This will be clarified as we step through the rest of the YAML file. . Part 2: Define Jobs . Next, we define jobs (there is only one in this workflow). Per the docs: . A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs. Jobs run in parallel by default. . jobs: build-site: if: ( github.event.commits[0].message != &#39;Initial commit&#39; ) || github.run_number &gt; 1 runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: . The keyword build-site is the name of your job and you can name it whatever you want. In this case, we have a conditional if statement that dictates if this job should be run or not. We are trying to ensure that this workflow does not run when the first commit to a repo is made with the message ‘Initial commit’. The first variable in the if statement, github.event, contains a json payload of the event that triggered this workflow. When developing workflows, it is helpful to print this variable in order to inspect its structure, which you can accomplish with the following YAML: . - name: see payload run: | echo &quot;PAYLOAD: n${PAYLOAD} n&quot; env: PAYLOAD: ${{ toJSON(github.event) }} . Note: the above step is only for debugging and is not currently in the workflow. . toJson is a handy function that returns a pretty-printed JSON representation of the variable. The output is printed directly in the logs contained in the Actions tab of your repo. In this example, printing the payload for a push event will look like this (truncated for brevity): . { &quot;ref&quot;: &quot;refs/tags/simple-tag&quot;, &quot;before&quot;: &quot;6113728f27ae8c7b1a77c8d03f9ed6e0adf246&quot;, &quot;created&quot;: false, &quot;deleted&quot;: true, &quot;forced&quot;: false, &quot;base_ref&quot;: null, &quot;commits&quot;: [ { &quot;message&quot;: &quot;updated README.md&quot;, &quot;author&quot;: &quot;hamelsmu&quot; }, ], &quot;head_commit&quot;: null, } . Therefore, the variable github.event.commits[0].message will retrieve the first commit message in the array of commits. Since we are looking for situations where there is only one commit, this logic suffices. The second variable in the if statement, github.run_number is a special variable in Actions which: . [is a] unique number for each run of a particular workflow in a repository. This number begins at 1 for the workflow’s first run, and increments with each new run. This number does not change if you re-run the workflow run. . Therefore, the if statement introduced above: . if: ( github.event.commits[0].message != &#39;Initial commit&#39; ) || github.run_number &gt; 1 . Allows the workflow to run when the commit message is “Initial commit” as long as it is not the first commit. ( || is a logical or operator). . Finally, the line runs-on: ubuntu-latest specifies the host operating system that your workflows will run in. . Part 3: Define Steps . Per the docs: . A job contains a sequence of tasks called steps. Steps can run commands, run setup tasks, or run an Action in your repository, a public repository, or an Action published in a Docker registry. Not all steps run Actions, but all Actions run as a step. Each step runs in its own process in the runner environment and has access to the workspace and filesystem. Because steps run in their own process, changes to environment variables are not preserved between steps. GitHub provides built-in steps to set up and complete a job. . Below are the first two steps in our workflow: . - name: Copy Repository Contents uses: actions/checkout@master with: persist-credentials: false - name: convert notebooks and word docs to posts uses: ./_action_files . The first step creates a copy of your repository in the Actions file system, with the help of the utility action/checkout. This utility only fetches the last commit by default and saves files into a directory (whose path is stored in the environment variable GITHUB_WORKSPACE that is accessible by subsequent steps in your job. The second step runs the fastai/fastpages Action, which converts notebooks and word documents to blog posts automatically. In this case, the syntax: . uses: ./_action_files . is a special case where the pre-made GitHub Action we want to run happens to be defined in the same repo that runs this workflow. This syntax allows us to test changes to this pre-made Action when evaluating PRs by referencing the directory in the current repository that defines that pre-made Action. Note: Building pre-made Actions is beyond the scope of this tutorial. . The next three steps in our workflow are defined below: . - name: setup directories for Jekyll build run: | rm -rf _site sudo chmod -R 777 . - name: Jekyll build uses: docker://hamelsmu/fastpages-jekyll with: args: bash -c &quot;gem install bundler &amp;&amp; jekyll build -V&quot; env: JEKYLL_ENV: &#39;production&#39; - name: copy CNAME file into _site if CNAME exists run: | sudo chmod -R 777 _site/ cp CNAME _site/ 2&gt;/dev/null || : . The step named setup directories for Jekyll build executes shell commands that remove the _site folder in order to get rid of stale files related to the page we want to build, as well as grant permissions to all the files in our repo to subsequent steps. . The step named Jekyll build executes a docker container hosted by the Jekyll community on Dockerhub called jekyll/jekyll. For those not familiar with Docker, see this tutorial. The name of this container is called hamelsmu/fastpages-jekyll because I’m adding some additional dependencies to jekyll/jekyll and hosting those on my DockerHub account for faster build times2. The args parameter allows you to execute arbitrary commands with the Docker container by overriding the CMD instruction in the Dockerfile. We use this Docker container hosted on Dockerhub so we don’t have to deal with installing and configuring all of the complicated dependencies for Jekyll. The files from our repo are already available in the Actions runtime due to the first step in this workflow, and are mounted into this Docker container automatically for us. In this case, we are running the command jekyll build, which builds our website and places relevant assets them into the _site folder. For more information about Jekyll, read the official docs. Finally, the env parameter allows me to pass an environment variable into the Docker container. . The final command above copies a CNAME file into the _site folder, which we need for the custom domain https://fastpages.fast.ai. Setting up custom domains are outside the scope of this article. . The final step in our workflow is defined below: . - name: Deploy if: github.event_name == &#39;push&#39; uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: deploy_key: ${{ secrets.SSH_DEPLOY_KEY }} publish_dir: ./_site . The statement . if: github.event_name == &#39;push&#39; . uses the variable github.event_name to ensure this step only runs when a push event ( in this case only pushes to the master branch trigger this workflow) occur. . This step deploys the fastpages website by copying the contents of the _site folder to the root of the gh-pages branch, which GitHub Pages uses for hosting. This step uses the peaceiris/actions-gh-pages Action, pinned at version 3. Their README describes various options and inputs for this Action. . Conclusion . We hope that this has shed some light on how we use GitHub Actions to automate fastpages. While we only covered one workflow above, we hope this provides enough intuition to understand the other workflows in fastpages. We have only scratched the surface of GitHub Actions in this blog post, but we provide other materials below for those who want to dive in deeper. We have not covered how to host an Action for other people, but you can start with these docs to learn more. . Still confused about how GitHub Actions could be used for Data Science?

            "title": "Introducing fastpages",
            "content": ". We are very pleased to announce the immediate availability of fastpages. fastpages is a platform which allows you to create and host a blog for free, with no ads and many useful features, such as: . Create posts containing code, outputs of code (which can be interactive), formatted text, etc directly from Jupyter Notebooks; for instance see this great example post from Scott Hawley. Notebook posts support features such as: Interactive visualizations made with Altair remain interactive. | Hide or show cell input and output. | Collapsable code cells that are either open or closed by default. | Define the Title, Summary and other metadata via a special markdown cells | Ability to add links to Colab and GitHub automatically. | . | Create posts, including formatting and images, directly from Microsoft Word documents. | Create and edit Markdown posts entirely online using GitHub&#39;s built-in markdown editor. | Embed Twitter cards and YouTube videos. | Categorization of blog posts by user-supplied tags for discoverability. | ... and much more | . fastpages relies on Github pages for hosting, and Github Actions to automate the creation of your blog. The setup takes around three minutes, and does not require any technical knowledge or expertise. Due to built-in automation of fastpages, you don&#39;t have to fuss with conversion scripts. All you have to do is save your Jupyter notebook, Word document or markdown file into a specified directory and the rest happens automatically. Infact, this blog post is written in a Jupyter notebook, which you can see with the &quot;View on GitHub&quot; link above. . fast.ai have previously released a similar project called fast_template, which is even easier to set up, but does not support automatic creation of posts from Microsoft Word or Jupyter notebooks, including many of the features outlined above. . Because fastpages is more flexible and extensible, we recommend using it where possible. fast_template may be a better option for getting folks blogging who have no technical expertise at all, and will only be creating posts using Github&#39;s integrated online editor. . Setting Up Fastpages . The setup process of fastpages is automated with GitHub Actions, too! Upon creating a repo from the fastpages template, a pull request will automatically be opened (after ~ 30 seconds) configuring your blog so it can start working. The automated pull request will greet you with instructions like this: . . All you have to do is follow these instructions (in the PR you receive) and your new blogging site will be up and running! . Jupyter Notebooks &amp; Fastpages . In this post, we will cover special features that fastpages provides has for Jupyter notebooks. You can also write your blog posts with Word documents or markdown in fastpages, which contain many, but not all the same features. . Options via FrontMatter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # Title &gt; Awesome summary - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . All of the above settings are enabled in this post, so you can see what they look like! . the summary field (preceeded by &gt;) will be displayed under your title, and will also be used by social media to display as the description of your page. | toc: setting this to true will automatically generate a table of contents | badges: setting this to true will display Google Colab and GitHub links on your blog post. | comments: setting this to true will enable comments. See these instructions for more details. | author this will display the authors names. | categories will allow your post to be categorized on a &quot;Tags&quot; page, where readers can browse your post by categories. | . Markdown front matter is formatted similarly to notebooks. The differences between the two can be viewed on the fastpages README. . Code Folding . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . .

How fastpages Converts Notebooks to Blog Posts . fastpages uses nbdev to power the conversion process of Jupyter Notebooks to blog posts. When you save a notebook into the /_notebooks folder of your repository, GitHub Actions applies nbdev against those notebooks automatically.

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
